<h3>Y2 2018 Yearlong: Flask routing</h3>
<h2>Welcome to the Flask routing lab!</h2>
<br>
Throughout this lab, you should be editing app.py.<br>
This lab is the beginning of a project that we'll be building on top of every session to help practice Python, Flask and Databases..So make sure to save your code! 
<br><br>
<h2>Part 1: Setting up flask</h2>
In this project you'll be creating an online shop of your choice!<br><br>
To start:<br>
- Create a very basic html file in the "templates" folder, then go to app.py and connect the html file to flask. <br>
Test it out and call us to check!<br>
(Hint: to see your page you should run app.py by typing "python app.py" in the terminal, and go to the link of the server in your browser)<br><br>
- Create a new .html file and call it "shop.html", this template will be used to show your products to the users in the next few sessions. 
<br>
<h4>Part 1 Bonus!</h4>
- Design the .html files<br>
- Create/Add a Navbar
<br>
<h2>Part 2: Routing</h2>
- Create a new app route "/shop", and link it to the shop.html template from the previous part.<br>
<h4>Part 2 Bonus!</h4>
- Connect shop.html and home.html together using buttons or navbars (Hint: Google "url_for").
<br>
<h2>Part 3: Style your home page:</h2>
- Create a list of product names and pass it to the shop.html template, have all product names show up in the shop template in order.
You can make it as a basic list using div and/or br tags , in a bootstrap grid system, or even in a more advanced styling from the web. Your call, be creative!
<br>
<h4>Part 3 Bonus!</h4>
- Add prices assigned to each product and show them on shop.html accordingly. (You can do this in many ways, google it!)
  <br>
- Start creating a basic template of a product page.
